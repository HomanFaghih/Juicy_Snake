# Juicy_Snake

## Description
**Juicy snake** used to be a simple classic snake game that I created in Unity just to practice C#. After watching "[juice it or lose it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg)" and "[The art of screenshake](https://youtu.be/AJdEqssNZ-U?si=aoTaZvNE6rFdv6ek)" I decided to juice my snake game! :tropical_drink:

## Features

- Simple gameplay
- The player moves around the screen one unit every FixedUpdate.
- The snake can eat apples, and when it does, the apple will spawn in another position(pooling).
- The apple script will check if it is on the player's body parts; if so, it will immediately spawn in another position.
- The camera shakes, the background color changes, and sound effects play when the snake eats an apple or the game is over.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to move the snake.
2. Just eat apples and avoid from walls and yourselfe!
