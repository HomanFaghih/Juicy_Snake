# Juicy_Snake

## Description
**Juicy snake** used to be a simple classic snake game that I created in Unity just to practice C#. After watching "[juice it or lose it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg)" and "[The art of screenshake](https://youtu.be/AJdEqssNZ-U?si=aoTaZvNE6rFdv6ek)" I decided to juice my snake game! :tropical_drink:
